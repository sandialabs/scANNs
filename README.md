# scANNs: Sampling Through COINFLIPS Artificial Neural Networks

## Installation

This implementation of scANNs relies on `numpy`, `keras` and `tensorflow`.  Any recent versions should be compatible, but this code was tested with `numpy 1.23.5`, `tensorflow 2.13` and `keras 2.13.1`.  Additionally, this code uses `keras`, but `tensorflow.keras` should work as well.  Just modify the code accordingly.
